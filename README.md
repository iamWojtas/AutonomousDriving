# Autonomous Driving
Internship project on autonomous vehicle control using custom hybrid control architecture. Classical control schemes enhanced by machine learning.

Includes classical discrete-time domain controllers:

* PID
* LQR
* MPC (LTI)


The next development step is to include some form of robust adaptation based on machine learning algotithms.
